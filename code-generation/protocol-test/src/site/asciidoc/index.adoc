== MSpec Code-Generation Documentation

=== Simple types

Some times no matter what content is coming, the same type is used. In this case a `type` is used:

[source]
include::{mspecdir}/protocols/test/test.mspec[tag=SimpleBitTypeTest]


[source]
----
include::{mspecdir}/protocols/test/test.mspec[lines=24..40]
----

The code generator will create simple POJOs as well as serializers and parsers from this specification.

=== Discriminated types

There are however cases, where the content of the packet determines it's type.
In these case a `discriminatedType` must be used.
Each `discriminatedType` must have one `discriminator` field and one `typeSwitch` field to define the sub-types.

[source]
----
include::{mspecdir}/protocols/test/test.mspec[lines=46..59]
----

In contrast to the simple types, in this case a base-type POJO will be created, which contains all the fields all sub-types share.
However these types are generated as abstract types.
The subtypes then extend these base-types.

=== Field types

In this section comes a description of all the different types of fields supported by the code generator.

==== array

An `array` field will generate an array property.
There are 3 variants of arrays which differ in the rule for how many elements the array should contain.

Right now these are:
- `count`: An explicit number of element will be read
- `length`: The number of bytes the entire array will consume (The parser will continue reading elements until the given number of bytes are read)
- `terminated`: The parser will continue to read elements until a given exit termination condition is `true`.

----
include::{mspecdir}/protocols/test/test.mspec[lines=25..27]
----

The general structure is:

[source]
----
[array {simple-type|complex-type} '{name}' {count|length|terminated} '{expression}']
----

Above definition generates the following code:

In the Pojo:

include::{sourcedir}/org/apache/plc4x/java/test/readwrite/SimpleType.java[lines=33..35;55..64;96..109;149..150]
----

In the IO component:
