/*
 * It is not only possible to exchange data between TwinCAT modules on one PC, it is even possible to do so by ADS
 * methods between multiple TwinCAT PC's on the network.
 * <p>
 * Every PC on the network can be uniquely identified by a TCP/IP address, such as "172.1.2.16". The AdsAmsNetId is an
 * extension of the TCP/IP address and identifies a TwinCAT message router, e.g. "172.1.2.16.1.1". TwinCAT message
 * routers exist on every TwinCAT PC, and on every Beckhoff BCxxxx bus controller (e.g. BC3100, BC8100, BC9000, ...).
 * <p>
 * The AmsNetId consists of 6 bytes and addresses the transmitter or receiver. One possible AmsNetId would be e.g.
 * "172.16.17.10.1.1". The storage arrangement in this example is as follows:
 * <p>
 * _____0     1     2     3     4     5
 * __+-----------------------------------+
 * 0 | 127 |  16 |  17 |  10 |   1 |   1 |
 * __+-----------------------------------+
 * <p>
 * The AmsNetId is purely logical and has usually no relation to the IP address. The AmsNetId is configured at the
 * target system. At the PC for this the TwinCAT System Control is used. If you use other hardware, see the considering
 * documentation for notes about settings of the AMS NetId.
