Apache PLC4X
============

Apache PLC4X is an effort to create a set of libraries for communicating with industrial grade programmable logic controllers (PLCs) in a uniform way.
We are planning on shipping libraries for usage in:

1) Java
2) Scala
3) C/C++

As well as provide direct integration into other Apache projects, such as:

1) Apache Calcite
2) Apache Camel
3) Apache Edgent
4) Apache Kafka-Connect
5) Apache Karaf
6) Apache NiFi


Environment
-----------

Currently the project is configured to require the following software:

1) Java 8 JDK: For running Maven in general as well as compiling the Java and Scala modules `JAVA_HOME configured to point to that.
2) libpcap/WinPcap for raw socket tests
3) (Optional) Graphwiz: For generating the graphs in the documentation (http://www.graphviz.org/)


Getting Started
---------------

You must have Java 8 installed on your system and connectivity to Maven Central
(for downloading external third party dependencies). Maven will be automatically
downloaded and installed by the maven wrapper `mvnw`.

Build PLC4X Java jars and install them in your local maven repository

$ ./mvnw install  # add -DskipTests to omit running the tests

You can now construct Java applications that use PLC4X. The PLC4X samples
are a good place to start and are available inside the `examples`
directory.

If you want to also build the C++ libraries, this has to be enabled by activating

the `with-cpp` profile

$ ./mvnw -P with-cpp install  # add -DskipTests to omit running the tests


Installing libpcap/WinPcap
--------------------------

Some parts of PLC4X, especially the raw socket support, require installed versions
of libpcap/WinPcap.

You can download the Mac/Linux version from: http://www.tcpdump.org/
The windows version can be found here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/winpcap413-176/
(In order to read PCAPNG files we require a libpcap version 1.1.0 or greater. The default
Windows version is 1.0. At this location is a patched version based on libpcap 1.7.4)


Building the C++ libraries
--------------------------

When building the C++ libraries we require an installed `gcc` compiler.
On Mac and Linux this is usually the case.
On a minimal Ubuntu Linux system the following modules needed to be installed
manually:

- gcc
- g++
- make

On Windows the required compiler is generally not available per default.
The build is optimized for using a gcc-port called MinGW, available from
http://win-builds.org/doku.php/download_and_installation_from_windows
Make sure the `bin` directory containing the executable `mingw32-make.exe`
is on your systems `PATH`.


Licensing
---------

Apache PLC4X is released under the Apache License Version 2.0.
