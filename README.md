## About Apache PLC4X

Apache PLC4X is an effort to create a set of libraries for communicating with industrial grade programmable logic controllers (PLCs) in a uniform way.
We are planning on shipping libraries for usage in:

1. Java
2. Go
3. C (not ready for usage)
4. Python (not ready for usage)
5. C# (.Net) (not ready for usage)

PLC4X also integrates with other Apache projects, such as:

* [Apache Calcite](https://calcite.apache.org/)
* [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/)
* [Apache Kafka-Connect](https://kafka.apache.org)
* [Apache Karaf](https://karaf.apache.org/)
* [Apache NiFi](https://nifi.apache.org/)

And brings stand-alone (Java) utils like:

* OPC-UA Server: Enables you to communicate with legacy devices using PLC4X with OPC-UA.
* PLC4X Server: Enables you to communicate with a central PLC4X Server which then communicates with devices via PLC4X.

It also provides (Java) tools for usage inside an application:

* Connection Cache: New implementation of our framework for re-using and sharing PLC-connections 
* Connection Pool: Old implementation of our framework for re-using and sharing PLC-connections
* OPM: Object-Plc-Mapping: Allows binding PLC fields to properties in java POJOs similar to JPA
* Scraper: Utility to do scheduled and repeated data collection.

## Getting started

Depending on the programming language, the usage will differ, therefore please go to the 
[Getting Started](https://plc4x.apache.org/users/gettingstarted.html) on the PLC4X website to look up 
the language of choice.

### Java

NOTE: Currently the Java version which supports building of all parts of Apache PLC4X is at least Java 11 (Currently with Java 19 the Apache Kafka integration module is excluded from the build as the plugins it requires are incompatible with this version)

See the PLC4J user guide on the website to start using PLC4X in your Java application:
[https://plc4x.apache.org/users/getting-started/plc4j.html](https://plc4x.apache.org/users/getting-started/plc4j.html)

## Developers

### Environment

Currently, the project is configured to require the following software:

1. Java 11 JDK: For running Maven in general as well as compiling the Java and Scala modules `JAVA_HOME` configured to point to that.
2. Git (even when working on the source distribution)
3. (Optional, for running all tests) libpcap/Npcap for raw socket tests in Java or use of `passive-mode` drivers
4. (Optional, for building the website) [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) : For generating the graphs in the documentation

WARNING: The code generation uses a utility which requires some additional VM settings. When running a build from the root, the settings in the `.mvn/jvm.config` are automatically applied. When building only a sub-module, it is important to set the vm args: `--add-exports jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.api=ALL-UNNAMED --add-exports jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.file=ALL-UNNAMED --add-exports jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.parser=ALL-UNNAMED --add-exports jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.tree=ALL-UNNAMED --add-exports jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.util=ALL-UNNAMED`. In Intellij for example set these in the IDE settings under: Preferences | Build, Execution, Deployment | Build Tools | Maven | Runner: JVM Options.

A more detailed description is available on our website:

https://plc4x.apache.org/developers/preparing/index.html

#### For building `PLC4C` we also need:

All requirements are retrieved by the build itself

#### For building `PLC4Go` we also need:

All requirements are retrieved by the build itself

#### For building `PLC4Py` we also need:

1. Python 3.7 or higher
2. Python pyenv

#### For building `PLC4Net` we also need:

1. DotNet SDK 6.0

With this setup you will be able to build the Java part of PLC4X.

The when doing a full build, we automatically run a prerequisite check and fail the build with an explanation, if not all requirements are meet.

### Building with Docker

If you don't want to bother setting up the environment on your normal system and you have Docker installed, you can also build everything in a Docker container:

```
   docker build -t plc4x .
```

### Getting Started

You must have at least Java 11 installed on your system and connectivity to Maven Central
(for downloading external third party dependencies). Maven 3.6 is required to build, so be sure it's installed and available on your system.

NOTE: When using Java 19 currently the Apache Kafka integration module is excluded from the build as one of the plugins it requires has proven to be incompatible with this version. 

NOTE: There is a convenience Maven-Wrapper installed in the repo, when used, this automatically downloads and installs Maven. If you want to use this, please use `./mvnw` or `mvnw` instead of the normal `mvn` command.

NOTE: When running from sources-zip, the `mvnw` might not be executable on `Mac` or `Linux`. This can easily be fixed by running the following command in the directory.

```
$ chmod +x mvnw
```

NOTE: If you are working on a `Windows` system, please use `mvnw.cmd` instead of `./mvnw` in the following build commands.

Build PLC4X Java jars and install them in your local maven repository

```
./mvnw install
```

You can now construct Java applications that use PLC4X. The PLC4X examples
are a good place to start and are available inside the `plc4j/examples`
directory.

The `Go` drivers can be built by enabling the `with-go` profile:

```
./mvnw -P with-go install 
```

The `C# / .Net` implementation is currently in a `work in progress` state.
In order to be able to build the `C# / .Net` module, you currently need to activate the:
`with-dotnet` profiles.

```
./mvnw -P with-dotnet install
```

The Python implementation is currently in a somewhat unclean state and still needs refactoring.
In order to be able to build the Python module, you currently need to activate the:
`with-sandbox` and `with-python` profiles.

```
./mvnw -P with-sandbox,with-python install
```

In order to build everything the following command should work:

```
./mvnw -P with-c,with-dotnet,with-go,with-python,with-sandbox install
```
