# Sample configuration for a standalone Kafka Connect worker that uses Avro serialization and
# integrates the the SchemaConfig Registry. This sample configuration assumes a local installation of
# Confluent Platform with all services running on their default ports.
# Bootstrap Kafka servers. If multiple servers are specified, they should be comma-separated.
bootstrap.servers=confluent:9092
# The converters specify the format of data in Kafka and how to translate it into Connect data.
# Every Connect user will need to configure these based on the format they want their data in
# when loaded from or stored into Kafka
