## Setting up in CLion

Per default CLion will not be able to run the tests. 
However it's pretty simple to setup.

In order to make this happen, you should add another `Profile` to your `CMake` configuration.

You can do this by going to: 

`Preferences...` / `Build, Execution, Deployment` / `CMake`

In the `Profiles` list, click on the `+` button to add a new profile.

I gave this profile the name `Test`.

In the settings select the `Build type` = `Debug`, `Toolchain` = `Use Default`.
`CMake options` = `-DUNITY_VERSION:STRING=2.5.0 -DBUILD_PHASE=test-compile`.

Leave the rest unchanged (which is actually empty).

After saving you can select the `Test` profile in the `Configurations` Drop-Down.
After that is selected, the tests should be available.
