==============================================================
(Unreleased) Apache PLC4X 0.7.0-SNAPSHOT
==============================================================

This version is the first after a major refactoring of the driver
core. All previous driver versions are now considered deprecated
and have been replaced by versions using the new driver structure
and generated driver codebase.

New Features
------------

- Drivers now support structured types using PlcValues
- The EIP (EtherNet/IP) driver no longer requires an external
  library and is implemented fully in the PLC4X project
- The Modbus driver no longer requires an external library
  and is implemented fully in the PLC4X project
- The new S7 Driver supports writing multiple entries in one
  request (The API allowed this from the beginning now not
  every item is wrapped in a single request. It should bring
  significant performance gains when writing multiple vlaues)

Incompatible changes
--------------------

- Due to the refactoring of the driver core there might be issues
  running drivers built against older core versions.
- This version doesn't provide a Beckhoff AMS/ADS driver as this
  driver is still being ported to the new mspec format.
- All drivers connection strings now follow the same pattern:
  {protocol-code:(transport-code:)?//{transport-config}(?{params})?
  Please check the drivers documentation on our website:
  https://plc4x.apache.org/users/protocols/s7.html

Bug Fixes
---------

PLC4X-174	UDP Transport does not accept ports containing 0
PLC4X-134   S7 is terminating the connection during handshake
PLC4X-192   Support for conversion of complex connection string
            parameters

==============================================================
(Unreleased) Apache PLC4X 0.6.0-SNAPSHOT
==============================================================

This is the last release of PLC4X with the "handwritten" drivers.
This Minor release will thus receive updates and fixes until
most users have switched to 0.7 and above (with generated drivers).

If you are using the S7 Driver you should update to this Version
as the critical (memory leak) bug PLC4X-163 is fixed.

New Features
------------
- PLC4X-168 A shorter S7 Field Syntax is Introduced.
This release contains no further features and mostly stabilization.

Incompatible changes
--------------------
- Moved the C++, C# and Python drivers into the `sandbox`

Bug Fixes
---------
- Fixed Promise Chain for InternalPlcWriteRequest
- PLC4X-45 Add float support to Modbus Protocol
- PLC4X-164 Fix wrong NOT FOUND exception in OPC UA Driver
- PLC4X-166 Fixed Download Page
- PLC4X-163 Fixed Netty ByteBuf Leaks for S7 Driver
- PLC4X-158 Added Warning if no Pooled Driver is used for Scraper

==============================================================
Apache PLC4X 0.5.0
==============================================================

This is the first release containing our new generated drivers (AB-ETH)

New Features
------------

- Implemented a new Apache Kafka Connect integration module
- Implemented a new Apache NiFi integration module
- Implemented a new Logstash integration module
- Implemented a driver for the AB-ETH protocol
- Implemented Apache Karaf features for S7 OSGI drivers
- PLC4X-121	Develop Code Generation to allow Generated Drivers in multiple Languages

- PLC4X-134	S7 is terminating the connection during handshake
- PLC4X-139	PLC4X leaks sockets in case of connection problems
- PLC4X-141	String with real length of greater 127 throw an exception
- PLC4X-144	When requesting invalid addresses, the DefaultS7MessageProcessor produces errors

==============================================================
Apache PLC4X 0.4.0
==============================================================

This is the first release of Apache PLC4X as top-level project.

New Features
------------

- The PlcConnection now supports a `ping` method to allow checking if an existing connection is still alive.
- Support of the OPC-UA protocol with the `opc-ua-driver`.
- Other Languages Support:
-- Added first versions of a C# .Net PLC4X API (`plc4net`)
-- Added first versions of a Python PLC4X API (`plc4py`)
- Added an Interop server which allows to relay requests from other languages to a Java Server

Incompatible changes
--------------------

- ElasticSearch example was updated to use ElasticSearch 7.0.1, this might cause problems with older Kibana versions.

Bug Fixes
---------


==============================================================
Apache PLC4X (incubating) 0.3.1
==============================================================

This is a bugfix-release, that fixes some problems with S7 driver.

Bug Fixes
---------

- The S7 driver didn't correctly handle "fill-bytes" in multi-item read-responses and multi-item write-requests
- PLC4X-83: fixed NPE when reading odd-length array of one-byte base types
- PLC4X-82: renamed flags "F" to Siemens Standard "M" (Marker)
- PLC4X-84: Fixed a bug in the DefaultS7MessageProcessor which didn't correctly merge together split up items


==============================================================
Apache PLC4X (incubating) 0.3.0
==============================================================

This is the third official release of Apache PLC4X.

Some new features have been added (e.g. plc-scraper) multiple
new integrations are included (apache-karaf, apache-calcite)
and a lot of (technical) refactoring has been done to prepare
future work on adapters in different languages.

New Features
------------

- Object PLC Mapping (OPM) now has a Alias Registry to allow
  variable substitution at runtime and write support
- New module `plc-scraper` for applications that have to
  scrape a lot of sps fields with high frequency
- New integration `apache-karaf` to enable plc4j in a karaf
  runtime environment

Incompatible changes
--------------------
- The 'plc4j-core' module has been merged into 'plc4j-api'.
  So there is no 'plc4j-core' module anymore. Just remove that
  dependency.
- The driver artifact names have changed so if you were using
  a `plc4j-protocol-{name}` you now need to change this to
  `plc4j-driver-{name}`

Bug Fixes
---------

PLC4X-75    Fixing dependency to the wrap url-handler
PLC4X-76    When receiving responses with more than 512 byte,
            the IsoOnTcp protocol doesn't work
PLC4X-77    When the last item in a request is a DINT, the
            DefaultS7MessageProcessor dies
PLC4X-78    Write operations seem to fail
-           Fixed a Bug where S7 was not able to read arrays.


==============================================================
Apache PLC4X (incubating) 0.2.0
==============================================================

This is the second official release of Apache PLC4X.

Especially have we addressed all issues reported during
our first release, that were of non-technical nature.
These were tracked in:

PLC4X-60	Fix findings by the last release

New Features
------------
A new connection-pool was added, which allows automatic
pooling and reuse of PLC connections.

A new OPM module was added, which allows JPA like read-
communication using POJOs, very similar to JPA.

A stub of a new driver for the Emerson DeltaV protocol
has been added, but is not yet a fully functional PLC4X
driver. This is also a first test of our new `passive-
mode-driver` concept.

Incompatible changes
--------------------

We have refactored the API in order to eliminate the
need of passing `x-requests` to `x-methods` and added
an `execute` method to each request type. This greatly
simplifies the client code. However this requires
refactoring of applications using the direct PLC4X API.

Miscellaneous changes
---------------------

We have increased the test coverage greatly and fixed
a lot of little errors we found on the way.

Known Issues
------------

Bug Fixes
---------

PLC4X-56	[S7] S7Field does not recognize addresses
            with numElements present
PLC4X-57	[S7] Response for address with numElements
            contains only first item
PLC4X-61	Installation fails plc4j-protocoll-ethernetip
            needs license
PLC4X-62	Modbus results deliver null-Value due to missing
            implementation of getShort, getLong ...



==============================================================
Apache PLC4X (incubating) 0.1.0
==============================================================

This is the first official release of Apache PLC4X.
It contains drivers for the following protocols:
- Siemens S7comm (0x32)
- Beckhoff ADS
- Modbus
- EtherNet/IP

However the Siemens driver definitely is the most
mature driver, the rest should be treated experimental.

New Features
------------

PLC4X-29	[S7] Implement PDU Fragmentation
PLC4X-39	Extend the Edgent integration with the new Subscription features of PLC4X

Incompatible changes
--------------------

- NONE -

Miscellaneous changes
---------------------  

- NONE -

Known Issues
------------

- NONE -

Most drivers should be treated experimental and are not near production ready.
The S7 driver is probably the furthest implemented and tested driver and hereby can be 
considered to be the most mature.

Bug Fixes
---------

PLC4X-20	Jacoco doesn't seem to be working at all
PLC4X-21	Code coverage doesn't seem to work
PLC4X-47	S7 driver silently ignores surplus ReadRequestItems
PLC4X-48	S7 driver failes to parse response with multiple items
