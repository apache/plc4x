|Default Transport 4+|`tcp`
|Supported Transports 4+|
 - `tcp`
5+|Config options:
|`target-ams-net-id` |STRING | |required |AMS-Net-Id of the target. An AMS-Net-Id has the regular format of an IPv4 IP-Address, however with 6 segments instead of 4.
|`target-ams-port` |INT | |required |AMS port of the target.
|`source-ams-net-id` |STRING | |required |AMS-Net-Id of the source. An AMS-Net-Id has the regular format of an IPv4 IP-Address, however with 6 segments instead of 4.
|`source-ams-port` |INT | |required |AMS port of the source.
|`timeout-request` |INT |4000| |Default timeout for all types of requests.
|`load-symbol-and-data-type-tables` |BOOLEAN |true| |Configures, if when connecting the data-type- and symbol-table should be read. This is an optimization that can help in cases, where the PLC program is pretty large and downloading the full tables is causing problems. When disabled, symbolic addresses will manually be resolved as soon as an address is used.
