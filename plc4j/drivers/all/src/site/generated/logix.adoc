 - `tcp`
5+|Config options:
|`communication-path` |STRING | | |The communication path allows for connection routing across multiple backplanes. It uses a common format found in Logix controllers. +
It consists of pairs of values, each pair begins with either 1 (Backplane) or 2 (Ethernet), followed by a slot in the case of a backplane address, +
or if using Ethernet an ip address. e.g. [1,4,2,192.168.0.1,1,1] - Routes to the 4th slot in the first rack, which is a ethernet module, it then connects to the address 192.168.0.1, then finds the module in slot 1.
|`backplane` |INT |1| |Without using routing information the backplane defaults to 1. This is overridden if communicationPath is provided.
|`slot` |INT |0| |The slot within the backplane the CPU is located.
|`big-endian` |BOOLEAN |true| |Configure if the connection should be set to transport data in Big-Endian format, or not.
|`force-unconnected-operation` |BOOLEAN |false| |Forces the driver to use unconnected requests. +
