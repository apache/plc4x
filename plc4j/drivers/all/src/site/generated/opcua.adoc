|Default Transport 4+|`tcp`
|Supported Transports 4+|
5+|Config options:
|`protocol-code` |string | | |
|`transport-code` |string | | |
|`transport-config` |string | | |
|`discovery` |boolean |true | |Controls the feature of the discovery endpoint of an OPC UA server which every server
will propagate over an '<address>/discovery' endpoint. The most common issue here is that most servers are not correctly
configured and propagate the wrong external IP or URL address. If that is the case you can disable the discovery by
configuring it with a `false` value.

The discovery phase is always conducted using `NONE` security policy.
|`username` |string | | |A username to authenticate to the OPCUA server with.
|`password` |string | | |A password to authenticate to the OPCUA server with.
|`security-policy` |org.apache.plc4x.java.opcua.security.SecurityPolicy |NONE | |The security policy applied to communication channel between driver and OPC UA server.
Default value assumes. Possible options are `NONE`, `Basic128Rsa15`, `Basic256`, `Basic256Sha256`, `Aes128_Sha256_RsaOaep`, `Aes256_Sha256_RsaPss`.
|`message-security` |org.apache.plc4x.java.opcua.security.MessageSecurity |SIGN_ENCRYPT | |The security policy applied to messages exchanged after handshake phase.
Possible options are `NONE`, `SIGN`, `SIGN_ENCRYPT`.
This option is effective only when `securityPolicy` turns encryption (anything beyond `NONE`).
|`key-store-file` |string | | |The Keystore file used to lookup client certificate and its private key.
|`key-store-type` |string |pkcs12 | |Keystore type used to access keystore and private key, defaults to PKCS (for Java 11+).
Possible values are between others `jks`, `pkcs11`, `dks`, `jceks`.
|`key-store-password` |string | | |Java keystore password used to access keystore and private key.
|`server-certificate-file` |string | | |Filesystem location where server certificate is located, supported formats are `DER` and `PEM`.
|`trust-store-file` |string | | |The trust store file used to verify server certificates and its chain.
|`trust-store-type` |string |pkcs12 | |Keystore type used to access keystore and private key, defaults to PKCS (for Java 11+).
Possible values are between others `jks`, `pkcs11`, `dks`, `jceks`.
|`trust-store-password` |string | | |Password used to open trust store.
|`serverCertificate` |java.security.cert.X509Certificate | | |
|`channel-lifetime` |long |3600000 | |Time for which negotiated secure channel, its keys and session remains open. Value in milliseconds, by default 60 minutes.
|`session-timeout` |long |120000 | |Expiry time for opened secure session, value in milliseconds. Defaults to 2 minutes.
|`negotiation-timeout` |long |60000 | |Timeout for all negotiation steps prior acceptance of application level operations - this timeout applies to open secure channel, create session and close calls. Defaults to 60 seconds.
|`request-timeout` |long |30000 | |Timeout for read/write/subscribe calls. Value in milliseconds.
|`encoding.receive-buffer-size` |int |65535 | |Maximum size of received TCP transport message chunk value in bytes.
|`encoding.send-buffer-size` |int |65535 | |Maximum size of sent transport message chunk.
|`encoding.max-message-size` |int |2097152 | |Maximum size of complete message.
|`encoding.max-chunk-count` |int |64 | |Maximum number of chunks for both sent and received messages.
