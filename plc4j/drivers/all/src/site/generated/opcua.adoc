|`discovery` |BOOLEAN |true| |Controls the feature of the discovery endpoint of an OPC UA server which every server +
will propagate over an '<address>/discovery' endpoint. The most common issue here is that most servers are not correctly +
configured and propagate the wrong external IP or URL address. If that is the case you can disable the discovery by +
configuring it with a `false` value. +
 +
The discovery phase is always conducted using `NONE` security policy.)
|`username` |STRING | | |A username to authenticate to the OPCUA server with.)
|`password` |STRING | | |A password to authenticate to the OPCUA server with.)
|`security-policy` |STRING |NONE| |The security policy applied to communication channel between driver and OPC UA server. +
Default value assumes. Possible options are `NONE`, `Basic128Rsa15`, `Basic256`, `Basic256Sha256`, `Aes128_Sha256_RsaOaep`, `Aes256_Sha256_RsaPss`.)
|`message-security` |STRING |SIGN_ENCRYPT| |The security policy applied to messages exchanged after handshake phase. +
Possible options are `NONE`, `SIGN`, `SIGN_ENCRYPT`. +
This option is effective only when `securityPolicy` turns encryption (anything beyond `NONE`).)
|`key-store-file` |STRING | | |The Keystore file used to lookup client certificate and its private key.)
|`key-store-type` |STRING |pkcs12| |Keystore type used to access keystore and private key, defaults to PKCS (for Java 11+). +
