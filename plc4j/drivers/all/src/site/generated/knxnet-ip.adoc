|Default Transport 4+|`udp`
|Supported Transports 4+|
 - `udp`
 - `pcap`
 - `raw`
5+|Config options:
|`knxproj-file-path` |string | | |Path to the `knxproj` file. The default KNXnet/IP protocol doesn't provide all the information needed to be able to fully decode the messages.
|`knxproj-password` |string | | |Optional password needed to read the knxproj file.
|`group-address-num-levels` |int |3 | |KNX Addresses can be encoded in multiple ways. Which encoding is used, is too not provided by the protocol itself so it has to be provided externally:

- 3 Levels: {main-group (5 bit)}/{middle-group (3 bit)}/{sub-group (8 bit)}
- 2 Levels: {main-group (5 bit)}/{sub-group (11 bit)}
- 1 Level: {sub-group (16 bit)}

The default is 3 levels. If the `knxproj-file-path` this information is provided by the file.
|`connection-type` |string |LINK_LAYER | |Type of connection used to communicate. Possible values are:

- 'LINK_LAYER' (default): The client becomes a participant of the KNX bus and gets it's own individual KNX address.
- 'RAW': The client gets unmanaged access to the bus (be careful with this)
- 'BUSMONITOR': The client operates as a busmonitor where he can't actively participate on the bus. Only one 'BUSMONITOR' connection is allowed at the same time on a KNXnet/IP gateway.
5+|Transport config options:
5+| - `udp`
|`udp.local-port` |int |-1 | |
5+| - `pcap`
|`pcap.replay-speed-factor` |float |1.0 | |When running in pcap-replay mode, the speed in which the replay should be done. `1.0f` being the normal speed.
|`pcap.loop` |boolean |false | |When running in pcap-replay mode, tell if the replay should start from the beginning once it reaches the end of the recording.
|`pcap.filter` |string | | |Filter expression used to filter out unwanted packets from the replay.
|`pcap.support-vlans` |boolean |false | |
|`pcap.protocol-id` |int |-1 | |
5+| - `raw`
|`raw.resolve-mac-address` |boolean | | |
|`raw.support-vlans` |boolean |false | |
|`raw.protocol-id` |int |-1 | |
