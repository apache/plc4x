 * Like JMS but different.
 * Maintain the same pattern as JMS MapMessage. 
 * S7Event is a Map whose key is a String and its value is an 
 * Object of primitive values.
 * Classes derived from the S7Event must respect the following 
 * conversion table.
 * 
 *  |        | boolean byte short char int long float double String byte[]
 *  |--------+-------------------------------------------------------------
 *  |boolean |    X                                            X
