# AWS IoT Core Example

This example requires AWS IoT Core.

To run this code, you need to set up the AWS IoT Core Device.

For how to configure AWS IoT Core, described here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/creating-a-virtual-thing.html
or https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/sdk-tutorials.html

Then, you can run the AWSIoTCoreSample,can send and receive PLC data to the cloud.
Some sample arguments:

    --cert DeviceCertPath.pem.crt 
    --key DevicePrivateKey.pem.key 
    --rootca AWSRootCACert.pem 
    --endpoint [yourendpoint].iot.ap-[region].amazonaws.com
    --username AWS_ID
    --password AWS_PW 
    --clientId DeviceID
    --connection-string PlcConnectionString
    --field-addresses address

An AWS Iot Core Java example is here: https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-java-v2/blob/main/samples/RawPubSub/src/main/java/rawpubsub/RawPubSub.java
