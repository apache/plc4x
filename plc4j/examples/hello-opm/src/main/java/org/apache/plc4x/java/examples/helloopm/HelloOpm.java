/**
 * This Example shows how to use OPM from plc4j via the @{@link PlcEntityManager}.
 * A @{@link PooledPlcDriverManager} is used to optimize the acces and to allow for automatic reconnection.
 *
 * The {@link PlcEntityManager} is similar to JPAs EntityManager.
 * The "connected" Entity (shootCounter) can be kept and passed around and stays connected in the sense that all calls
 * to a getter are forwared to the PLC.
 * Finally, one can disconnect the Entity.
 *
 * This MT works against Tims S7 in NÃ¼rtingen.
 * Thus, parameters have to be tuned possibly to get "good" values.
