/**
 * Base type for all tag types.
 * Typically, every driver provides an implementation of this interface in order
 * to be able to describe the tags of a resource. As this is completely tied to
 * the implemented protocol, this base interface makes absolutely no assumption to
 * any information it should provide.
 *
 * In order to stay platform and protocol independent every driver connection implementation
 * provides a parseTagAddress(String) method that is able to parse a string representation of
 * a resource into it's individual tag type. Manually constructing PlcTag objects
 * manually makes the solution less independent of the protocol, but might be faster.
