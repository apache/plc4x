 * the implemented protocol, this base interface makes absolutely no assumption to
 * any information it should provide.
 *
 * In order to stay platform and protocol independent every driver connection implementation
 * provides a prepareField(String) method that is able to parse a string representation of
 * a resource into it's individual field type. Manually constructing PlcField objects
 * manually makes the solution less independent from the protocol, but might be faster.
