The people working on Apache PLC4X, and the companies behind them have put an enormous amount of effort into creating this great tool.

The problem some of them are facing, is that they are usually not allowed to mention which companies are using PLC4X.

However being able to name references is most vital nowdays in gaining trust.

So if you work for a company which is using Apache PLC4X, one way you can help the project is by admitting you are using it.

This might be only very little active contribution on your side, but for the project this is of extremely high value.

On this page we are maintaining a list of companies openly communicating that they are using Apache PLC4X.

If your company is using Apache PLC4X and you would like to give back to the community, please create a Pull-Request on github or post an email to dev@plc4x.apache.org and give us the permission to list your company.
