== Using SNAPSHOT versions

Especially when it comes to trying to verify if an issue you are facing has already been fixed in the development version, you might want to or be asked to try out the absolute latest version of PLC4X. You can generally do this by adding "-SNAPSHOT" to the version number of PLC4X.

We also provide convenience built `SNAPSHOT` versions, however are these not automatically synced with `Maven Central`. So Maven will not automatically be able to find them.

Our `SNAPSHOT` versions are deployed on the `Apache Maven repository`.

In order to access these, you need to add the following block to your `pom.xml` file:

[subs=attributes+]
----
  <!-- Make Snapshots of Apache projects available -->
  <repositories>
    <repository>
      <id>apache-snapshots</id>
      <url>https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
      <releases>
        <enabled>false</enabled>
      </releases>
      <snapshots>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
      </snapshots>
    </repository>
  </repositories>

  <!-- Make Snapshots of Apache plugins available -->
  <pluginRepositories>
    <pluginRepository>
      <id>apache-snapshots</id>
      <url>https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
      <releases>
        <enabled>false</enabled>
      </releases>
      <snapshots>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
      </snapshots>
    </pluginRepository>
  </pluginRepositories>
----

After adding this block, you should be able to also use `SNAPSHOT` versions.
