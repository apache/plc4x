=== Current Releases

==== 0.10.0 Official https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/plc4x/0.10.0/apache-plc4x-0.10.0-source-release.zip[source release] [ https://downloads.apache.org/plc4x/0.10.0/apache-plc4x-0.10.0-source-release.zip.sha512[SHA512] ] [ https://downloads.apache.org/plc4x/0.10.0/apache-plc4x-0.10.0-source-release.zip.asc[ASC] ]

A lot of the work in this version went into refactoring and
cleaning up our code generation. The code generation itself is
now a lot cleaner and simpler as well as the code generated
for Java. We also added a number of new field-types to allow
implementing more sophisticated protocols. PLC4C now should
also support all of the constructs mspec has to offer.

===== New Features

- Implemented a `PLC4X-Server` and `PLC4X-Driver` that allows
using the server as a proxy for communicating with PLCs.

- The Modbus driver is now also available in the variants:
"modbus-rtu" and "modbus-ascii" (Both using Serial
communication, which however can be tunneled through a
"tcp" and "udp" transport)

- The KNX driver in Java now supports reading "knxproj" files
exported from the new ETS version 6.

===== Bug Fixes

- The name of the Modbus TCP driver was changed from "modbus"
to "modbus-tcp".

- Removed the Apache Edgent (incubating) integration and
examples related, as Edgent is abandoned and there were
CVEs reported, which will not be fixed.

- We have replaced the BitString types with BYTE, WORD, DWORD,
and LWORD which generally match their unsigned integer
counterparts. So we are no longer returning lists of boolean
values for any of these types.

=== Previous Releases

- Fixed a big bug in the KNX Datapoint decoding, which caused
byte-aligned data types to parse with an offset of 8 bit.
(This bug affected both the Java and the Go driver)

==== 0.9.1 Official https://archive.apache.org/dist/plc4x/0.9.1/apache-plc4x-0.9.1-source-release.zip[source release] [ https://downloads.apache.org/plc4x/0.9.1/apache-plc4x-0.9.1-source-release.zip.sha512[SHA512] ] [ https://downloads.apache.org/plc4x/0.9.1/apache-plc4x-0.9.1-source-release.zip.asc[ASC] ]

This is a bugfix release aiming at directly fixing CVE-2021-43083 as well as updating the dependency to Log4J 2.14.0 which was affected by CVE-2021-44228

Please note that CVE-2021-43083 only affects the PLC4C part of PLC4X.

===== Bug Fixes

CVE-2021-43083 Apache PLC4X 0.9.0 Buffer overflow in PLC4C via crafted server response

=== Previous Releases

[#release-0_9_0]
==== 0.9.0 Official https://archive.apache.org/dist/plc4x/0.9.0/apache-plc4x-0.9.0-source-release.zip[source release] [ https://archive.apache.org/dist/plc4x/0.9.0/apache-plc4x-0.9.0-source-release.zip.sha512[SHA512] ] [ https://archive.apache.org/dist/plc4x/0.9.0/apache-plc4x-0.9.0-source-release.zip.asc[ASC] ]

This is an ordinary PLC4X release, containing changes that
accumulated over time. It doesn't have an explicit focus on
a particular topic.

===== New Features

- The OPC UA driver has been replaced with a native driver. Previously
Eclipse Milo was being used.
- Permit customized package names for code generation
- Added an initial draft of a Discover and Browse API to PLC4J
- PLC4Go now supports many more drivers
- PLC4Go received a huge internal refactoring and cleanup
- Major cleanup of PLC4C
- S7 Driver now supports event and alarm handling on some S7 models

===== Incompatible changes

===== Bug Fixes

PLC4X-200   OPC-UA Driver not connecting if params string is not provided
PLC4X-201   OPC-UA PlcList underlying type not compatible with Eclipse Milo
PLC4X-202   OPC-UA Driver cannot write Unsigned Types
PLC4X-276   [S7] The most of the supported types don't work correctly
PLC4X-278   Double Reading Error
PLC4X-279   nioEventLoopGroup thread proliferation
PLC4X-280   ADS route request swapped positions of route name and address
PLC4X-291   DefaultPlcSubscriptionField cannot be cast to class OpcuaField
PLC4X-298   [S7] When writing REAL values the Write
operation fails with an internal error
PLC4X-299   Modbus - Kafka Connect Configuration

[#release-0_8_0]
==== 0.8.0 Official https://archive.apache.org/dist/plc4x/0.8.0/apache-plc4x-0.8.0-source-release.zip[source release] [ https://archive.apache.org/dist/plc4x/0.8.0/apache-plc4x-0.8.0-source-release.zip.sha512[SHA512] ] [ https://archive.apache.org/dist/plc4x/0.8.0/apache-plc4x-0.8.0-source-release.zip.asc[ASC] ]

This is an ordinary PLC4X release, containing changes that
accumulated over time. It doesn't have an explicit focus on
a particular topic.

===== New Features

- The KNXnet/IP Driver now supports writing of values.
- The Modbus driver now supports more common notations of Modbus addresses using a pure-numeric notation.
- The ADS, KNX, Modbus, S7 and simulated drivers have been updated to support the IEC 61131-3 data-types.
- We are now including PLC4Go as PLC4X implementation in the programming language Go(lang)
- Integration with the Milo OPC UA Server is now available.
- Kafka Connect workers have been updated source and sink connectors are now included.

===== Incompatible changes

- The syntax of the S7 addresses changed slightly allowing to provide a string length. Without this, a STRING datatype will read 254 characters, by adding the size in round brackets to the type name will use the specified number.

  Examples:

  Read one String which is max 10 chars long:
  %DB2:30:STRING(10)

  Read an array of 3 Strings where each is max 10 chars long:
  %DB2:30:STRING(10)[3]

- The PLCValue types have been refactored to align with the types defined in IEC 61131-3 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_61131-3) directly using the older Java types (PlcBoolean) is no longer possible.

===== Bug Fixes

A lot of testing was done regarding the IEC 61131-3 data-types.
This resulted in numerous bugfixes in many protocols.

- PLC4X-132  [S7] Communication to S7 PLC dies in some situations
- PLC4X-206  When writing short values exceptions are thrown while preparing the write request.

[#release-0_7_0]
==== 0.7.0 Official https://archive.apache.org/dist/plc4x/0.7.0/apache-plc4x-0.7.0-source-release.zip[source release] [ https://archive.apache.org/dist/plc4x/0.7.0/apache-plc4x-0.7.0-source-release.zip.sha512[SHA512] ] [ https://archive.apache.org/dist/plc4x/0.7.0/apache-plc4x-0.7.0-source-release.zip.asc[ASC] ]

This version is the first after a major refactoring of the driver
core. All previous driver versions are now considered deprecated
and have been replaced by versions using the new driver structure
and generated driver codebase.

===== New Features

- Drivers now support structured types using PlcValues
- The EIP (EtherNet/IP) driver no longer requires an external
library and is implemented fully in the PLC4X project
- The Modbus driver no longer requires an external library
and is implemented fully in the PLC4X project
- The new S7 Driver supports writing multiple entries in one
request (The API allowed this from the beginning now not
every item is wrapped in a single request. It should bring
significant performance gains when writing multiple vlaues)
- S7 Driver now supports String datatypes.
- OSGi : Implementation of Drivers/Transports as OSGi services
to be able to use them in an OSGi container.
- New Firmata protocol driver

===== Incompatible changes

- Due to the refactoring of the driver core there might be issues
running drivers built against older core versions.
- This version doesn't provide a Beckhoff AMS/ADS driver as this
driver is still being ported to the new mspec format.
- All drivers connection strings now follow the same pattern:
{protocol-code:(transport-code:)?//{transport-config}(?{params})?
Please check the drivers documentation on our website:
https://plc4x.apache.org/users/protocols/s7.html
- The karaf-feature modules are removed as the drivers now all
provide both a feature.xml as well as a `kar` bundled archive

===== Bug Fixes

- PLC4X-174  UDP Transport does not accept ports containing 0
- PLC4X-134  S7 is terminating the connection during handshake
- PLC4X-192  Support for conversion of complex connection string parameters

[#release-0_6_0]
==== 0.6.0 Official https://archive.apache.org/dist/plc4x/0.6.0/apache-plc4x-0.6.0-source-release.zip[source release] [ https://archive.apache.org/dist/plc4x/0.6.0/apache-plc4x-0.6.0-source-release.zip.sha512[SHA512] ] [ https://archive.apache.org/dist/plc4x/0.6.0/apache-plc4x-0.6.0-source-release.zip.asc[ASC] ]

This is the last release of PLC4X with the "handwritten" drivers.
This Minor release will thus receive updates and fixes until
most users have switched to 0.7 and above (with generated drivers).

If you are using the S7 Driver you should update to this Version
as the critical (memory leak) bug PLC4X-163 is fixed.

===== New Features

- PLC4X-168 A shorter S7 Field Syntax is Introduced.
This release contains no further features and mostly stabilization.
