3+|Options

|
| `communicationPath`
| The communication path allows for connection routing across multiple backplanes. It uses a common format found in logix controllers.
It consists of pairs of values, each pair begins with either 1 (Backplane) or 2 (Ethernet), followed by a slot in the case of a backplane address,
or if using Ethernet an ip address. e.g. [1,4,2,192.168.0.1,1,1] - Routes to the 4th slot in the first rack, which is a ethernet module, it then connects to the address 192.168.0.1, then finds the module in slot 1.

|
| `backplane` (1)
| Without using routing information the backplane defaults to 1. This is overridden if communicationPath is provided.

|
| `slot` (1)
| The slot within the backplane the CPU is located.

=== Individual Resource Address Format

==== Connection String

Logix has the following connection string format:-
----
logix:tcp://{ip-address}:{port}?{options}
----
An example connection string would look like:-
----
logix:tcp://127.0.0.1:502?communicationPath=[1,1]
----
Note the port and option fields are optional.


==== General Format

In general all Logix addresses have this format:

----
{address}:{data-type}[{array-size}]
----

If the array-size part is omitted, the size-default of `1` is assumed.
If the data-type part is omitted, the data type from the controller is used
The address format matches that found in the controller.

==== Data Types

The following data types are supported

- BOOL (boolean)
- SINT (int 8)
- USINT (uint 8)
- BYTE (uint 8)
- INT (int 16)
- UINT (uint 16)
- WORD (uint 16)
- DINT (int 32)
- UDINT (uint 32)
- DWORD (uint 32)
- LINT (int 64)
- REAL (float)
