=== Address Format

To read and write data to a PLC4X device, the EtherNet/IP driver uses symbolic segments.
 This is used to refer to objects through their symbolic names. This makes reading data a lot easier, as you do not
 need to specify the Datatype for reading.

%{tagname}[{startIndex}]:{numberOfElements}:{DataType}

|Start Index (optional)|if the data is an array, we can specify a starting index from where we want to read
|Number of elements (optional)|if the data is an array, we can specify the number of elements we want to read. Use this in combination with the starting index to get the exact scope you want.
|DataType (writing) |Specify the Data-type of the value you want to write (mandatory)
