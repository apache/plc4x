3+|Supported Operations
|
| `read`
|Read tags from a PLC4X device

|
| `write`
|Write values to tags on a PLC4X device

3+|Options

|
| `backplane`
| `backplane` value for the client (PLC4X device). Mandatory.

|
| `slot` 
| `slot` value for the client (PLC4X device). Mandatory.

=== Address Format
To read and write data to a PLC4X device, the EtherNet/IP driver uses symbolic segments.
 This is used to refer to objects through their symbolic names. This makes reading data a lot easier, as you do not
 need to specify the Datatype for reading.
