== Firmata

The Firmata protocol is based on the MIDI protocol used for communicating with musical equipment.

It is also one of the most widely used protocols for communication with Arduino devices.

This driver is built to be compatible with the `StandardFirmata Arduino Sketch` which can be found https://github.com/firmata/arduino/blob/master/examples/StandardFirmata/StandardFirmata.ino[here] (Version last changed on August 17th, 2017)

=== Connection String Options

include::../../../plc4j/drivers/all/src/site/generated/firmata.adoc[]

[cols="2,2a,5a"]
|===
|Name |Value |Description
3+|Supported Operations

|
| `write`
| Writing is only supported to digital addresses.

|
| `subscribe`
| Reading is supported for both digital and analog addresses. See `note` after this table however.

|===

NOTE: When subscribing to pins, these are configured to become read pins. When writing to digital pins, these are configured to become output pins. However, writing to pins for which a subscription exists, an exception will be thrown. In order to write to previously subscribed pins, all subscriptions for this have to be cancelled first.

=== Individual Resource Address Format

Similar to the Modbus protocol, the Firmata protocol support Boolean and Short values.

Booleans are used for the digital IO pins and short values for the analog inputs.

==== Binary Addresses

The full format for a digital address has the following format:

----
digital:{start-address}[{array-size}]:{special-config}
----

The `start-address` and `array-size` are simple integer values.
`special-config` can be used to configure the digital input pin to something else than `INPUT`.

Currently the only supported option is `PULLUP` which configured the Arduino's digital input pin to use it's built in pullup-resistor.

Both the `array-size` as well as the `special-config` parts are optional. So the following example addresses are valid:

----
digital:4
digital:4[5]
digital:4:PULLUP
----

A normal `Arduino Uno` is equipped with 14 digital inputs: 0-13

WARNING: However in case of using the serial port (which will always be the case when using this driver), the pins 0 and 1 are the `RX` and `TX` pins of the serial port and can't be used.

==== Analog Addresses

The full format for an analog address is as follows:

----
analog:{start-address}[{array-size}]
----

The `start-address` and `array-size` are simple integer values.

Both the `array-size` is optional. So the following example addresses are valid:

----
analog:1
analog:2[3]
----

A normal `Arduino Uno` is equipped with 6 analog inputs: 0-5
