=== Connection String Options

=== Individual Resource Address Format

KNX Addresses usually have one of the following structures:

- 3-level Address: `{main-group(0-15)}`/`{middle-group(0-15)}`/`{sub-group(0-255)}`
- 2-level Address: `{main-group(0-15)}`/`{sub-group(0-4095)}`
- 1-level Address: `{sub-group(0-65535)}`

Depending on the `group-address-type` configured in the connection string or defined in the knxproj-file configured by the `knxproj-file-path` connection string parameter, the corresponding address pattern has to be used.

However, when subscribing for events, each segment allows using of the wildcard character `*`.
If the addresses used in the KNX installation are structured, this way it is possible to, for example (depending on the scheme used):

- Collect all information for a given level of your building: `1/*/*`
- Collect all information for a given room: `2/4/*`
- Collect all information about heating in all rooms: `*/*/50`

NOTE: Don't use wildcards when explicitly reading or writing data, this is only supported when subscribing to events.
