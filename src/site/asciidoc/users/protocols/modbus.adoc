=== Individual Resource Address Format

In contrast to most other protocols Modbus only supports two datatypes.

- Bit (Coil)
- Short (2-bytes) (Registers)

Some implementations implement more types based on these, such as 16 bit half-precision floating point types wrapped in a Register or joining multiple Coils or Registers to bigger data-types, but this is not handled by the Modbus specification.

Coils and Registers are generally separated into pure inputs which are read-only and writable versions.

Inputs (Read-Only):

- Discrete Input (Boolean / 1 bit)
- Input Register (Short / 16 bi)

Output (Read/Write):

- Coil (Boolean / 1 bit)
- Holding Register (Short / 16 bi)

Here come the syntax descriptions of these addresses (Each address can reference either a single item or an array):

[cols="2,2a,5,1"]
|===
|Name |Address Syntax |Description |Bit-Size

|Discrete Input   |`discrete-input:{start-address}` or `discrete-input:{start-address}[{count}]` or `1{start-address}` or `1{start-address}[{count}]` or `1x{start-address}` or `1x{start-address}[{count}]`   |Read-only Boolean input value, usually representing a binary input to the PLC |1
|Input Register   |`input-register:{start-address}` or `input-register:{start-address}[{count}]` or `3{start-address}` or `3{start-address}[{count}]` or `3x{start-address}` or `3x{start-address}[{count}]`   |Read-only Short input value, usually representing an analog input to the PLC  |16
|Coil             |`coil:{start-address}` or `coil:{start-address}[{count}]` or `0{start-address}` or `0{start-address}[{count}]` or `0x{start-address}` or `0x{start-address}[{count}]`             |Read/Write Boolean value, usually representing a binary output from the PLC   |1
|Holding Register |`holding-register:{start-address}` or `holding-register:{start-address}[{count}]` or `4{start-address}` or `4{start-address}[{count}]` or `4x{start-address}` or `4x{start-address}[{count}]` |Read/Write Short value, usually representing an analog output from the PLC    |16
