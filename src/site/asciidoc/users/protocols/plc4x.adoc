==== Connection String

The `plc4x` protocol connection has the following connection string format:-
----
plc4x:{transport}://{ip-address/hostname}:{port}?remote-connection-string={url-encoded-connection-string}
----

An example connection string would look like:-
----
plc4x://127.0.0.1?remote-connection-string=simulated%3A%2F%2Flocalhost
----
Note the transport, port and option fields are optional.
The remote connection string: `simulated://localhost` is encoded as `simulated%3A%2F%2Flocalhost`

==== General Format

The address format is simply the address format of the used remote connection.
So if you specify a remote connection as `simulated`, please follow the address format of that driver.
