=== Individual Resource Address Format

==== Connection String

The simulated driver has the following connection string format:-
----
simulated:{transport}://{ip-address}:{port}
----
An example connection string would look like:-
----
simulated://127.0.0.1
----
Note the transport and port fields are optional.


==== General Format

The simulated addresses have this format:

----
{simulation-type}/{alias}:{data-type}[{array-size}]
----

If the array-size part is omitted, the default size of `1` is assumed.
If the data-type part is omitted, it defaults to STRING.

==== Simulation Types

The simulation device supports 3 different simulation types

- STATE - This holds in memory a value for a given alias. This value can be read or written to, however this
should only be used in conjunction with a persistent connection. Once the connection is closed the memory area is cleared.
- RANDOM - This provides a new random value for each read. When writing, a log message is recorded and the value is discarded.
- STDOUT - Always returns a null value when reading. When writing, a log message is recorded and the value is discarded.

==== Alias

Aliases are used to identify the different field addresses.
They should only contain alpha-numeric and the full stop (.) character.
For readability and language specific technical purposes they should be less than 256 characters.

==== Data Types

The following data types are supported:-

- BOOL (boolean)
- SINT (int 8)
- USINT (uint 8)
- BYTE (uint 8)
- INT (int 16)
- UINT (uint 16)
- WORD (uint 16)
- DINT (int 32)
- UDINT (uint 32)
- DWORD (uint 32)
- LINT (int 64)
- ULINT (uint 64)
- LWORD (uint 64)
- REAL (float)
- LREAL (double)
- CHAR (char)
- WCHAR (2 byte char)
- STRING (254 bytes)

==== Some useful tips

The simulation driver uses a lot of the same logic templates that is used for the other drivers. It is a good way to test PLC4X
functionality without having a device to connect to.

==== Examples

All of these address formats are valid:-

- RANDOM/foo:INT
- RANDOM/foo:UDINT
- RANDOM/device1.machineA.sensor1:UINT
- RANDOM/device1.machineA.sensor1:STRING
- STATE/device1.machineA.sensor1:INT
- STDOUT/device1.machineA.sensor1:INT
