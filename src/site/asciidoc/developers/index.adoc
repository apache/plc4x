== Developer Section

This part of the Apache PLC4X dedicated to provide information to people wanting to build PLC4X and hopefully also start contributing to this awesome project.

=== Getting Started

We have tried to make the PLC4X build experience as smooth as possible and have tried to reduce the number of required third party tools to an absolute minimum.

The full PLC4X build however builds not only `Java` libraries, but also `C++`, `Python` and `C#` libraries as well as builds `Docker` images on `Linux`, `Mac` and `Windows`.

As a start, you will basically need a `Java VM` of at least `Java 11`.

Using the `Maven-Wrapper` you don't even need a `Maven` installation. The build will automatically fetch the right version for you.

As part of the build we have an initial build step that will do a `prerequisite check`. Depending on the activated modules, it will check if all preconditions are met and tell you what's missing.

For details please have a look at the link:preparing/index.html[Preparing your Computer] page.

=== Building PLC4X

We have a dedicated page on link:building.html[Building PLC4X].

Please read this page on information about how to build Apache PLC4X.

=== Contributing

If you want to work on Apache PLC4X in order to `fix things`, `add things` and start `contributing` in general, please have a look at our link:contributing.html[Contributing] page. It should contain all the information you need.

=== Getting Help

The primary source for getting help definitely is our project mailing list dev@plc4x.apache.org.
