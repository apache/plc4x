== Decision Making

=== Introduction

This document describes the roles and responsibilities of the project, who may vote, how voting works, how conflicts are resolved, etc.

The https://www.apache.org/foundation/faq[Apache Foundation FAQ] and http://www.apache.org/foundation/faq.html[How-It-Works] explain the operation and background of the foundation. Terms used are defined in the https://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary[ASF glossary].

Apache has a http://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html[code of conduct] that it expects its members to follow.

=== Roles and Responsibilities

Apache projects define a set of https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#roles[roles] with associated rights and responsibilities.

==== Project Management Committee

The http://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html#what-is-a-pmc[PMC] has many https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#pmc[responsibilities] including complying with http://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html#policy[ASF policies], https://www.apache.org/foundation/board/reporting[reporting to the board], https://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html[approving releases] and adding new http://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html#newcommitter[committers] and http://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html#newpmc[PMC members].

==== The Chair

The http://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html#chair[chair] ensures board reports are submitted and that the project's roster is up to date.

=== Decision Making

Different decisions require different forms of approval but community consensus is always the goal. Voting when needed should be open for http://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html#release-approval[at least 72 hours].

- https://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#ConsensusApproval[Consensus Approval] – Consensus approval requires 3 https://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html#binding-votes[binding] +1 votes and no -1 votes (https://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#Veto[vetoes]).
- https://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#MajorityApproval[Majority Approval] – requires at least 3 https://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html#binding-votes[binding] +1 votes more +1 votes than -1 votes.
- https://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#LazyConsensus[Lazy Consensus] – consensus no objections (‘silence gives assent’).
