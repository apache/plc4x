== Preparing your Computer

Building a project like Apache PLC4X on multiple target operating-systems is quite a challenge, but I think we managed to make it as simple as possible.

However when building any of the parts of PLC4X there are some requirements the build is expecting you to have provided.

In order to build at all you are required to have `Java 8` installed on your machine.
We have tested the build with Java 8 up to Java 13.
If a new version comes out, please give us a little time to handle any related issues, but we'll probably fix them as soon as possible.
However in the past with Oracle's new release strategy, there have been a few bumps on the road.
