== Linux

=== Git

Checking:

 git --version

If you get any successful output, you probably don't need to do anything.

Apt-based systems:

 sudo apt install git

Yum based systems:

 sudo yum install git

=== LibPCAP

Apt-based systems:

 sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev

Yum based systems:

 sudo yum install libpcap-devel

Using libpcap usually requires root privileges, however the java process can be granted permission to do so by executing the following command.

 setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip /path/to/java

Some times I had to set the uid to execute the java executable with the permissions of the owner (root) ... however this is quite sub-optimal solution.

 chmod 4755 /path/to/java

=== gcc

Checking:

 gcc --version

If you get any successful output, you probably don't need to do anything.

Apt-based systems:

 sudo apt-get install gcc

Yum based systems:

 sudo yum install gcc

=== g++

Checking:

 g++ --version

If you get any successful output, you probably don't need to do anything.

Apt-based systems:

 sudo apt-get install g++

Yum based systems:

 sudo yum install g++

=== dotnet

Checking:

 dotnet --version

If you get any successful output, you probably don't need to do anything.

Microsoft has documented what is needed to install `.Net SDK` https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/linux-package-manager/rhel/sdk-2.2.203[here]

For Ubuntu this would be:

 wget http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/i/icu/libicu57_57.1-6+deb9u4_amd64.deb
 sudo dpkg -i libicu57_57.1-6+deb9u4_amd64.deb
 wget -q https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/16.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb
 sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
 sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install dotnet-sdk-2.2

For other distributions, please select the distribution in the drop-down menu and follow the instructions there.

=== python

Checking:

 python --version

If you get a version of 2.7 or higher reported, you probably don't need to do anything.

Apt-based systems:

 sudo apt-get install python-dev

Yum based systems:

 yum install gcc
 cd /usr/src
 wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.10/Python-2.7.10.tgz
 tar xzf Python-2.7.10.tgz
 cd Python-2.7.10
 ./configure
 make altinstall

=== Python setuptools

Checking:

 python -c "import setuptools"

If this just exists and doesn't report an error, you're ok. If it complains about "No module named setuptools", then you need to install it.

Apt-based systems:

 sudo apt-get install python-setuptools


=== bison

Checking:

 bison --version

If you get a version above 2.3 output, you don't need to do anything.

Apt-based systems:

 sudo apt-get install bison

Yum based systems:

 sudo yum install bison-devel

=== flex

 flex --version

If you get any successful output, you probably don't need to do anything.
