== Mac OS

As tracking down issues which result from missing or outdated third party tools such as compilers are always hard do diagnose, we have extended the build of PLC4X with a `prerequisiteCheck` that automatically checks if required tools are installed and if a required minimum version is available.

If any of the prerequisites are not met, the build fails with an error message that will help finding out what's wrong.

The number of checks is highly dependent on which profiles are enabled.
So for example the availability and version of the C compiler is only checked if the `with-c` profile is enabled.

Most libraries on Mac are installed using `Homebrew`.

Make sure `Homebrew` ist installed in order to install most of these.

    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

=== Git

Checking:

 git --version

If you get any successful output, you probably don't need to do anything.

If you are running this command on a really fresh and clean system, it might be that you are asked to finish installing the XCode commandline tools.
If this happens, just follow the process and re-try after it has finished.

If you get a response that indicates that git needs to be installed, please execute the following command:

 brew install git

=== Java

Checking:

 java --version

If you get successful output indicating at least Java 11, you don't need to do anything.

Apt based systems:

 brew install openjdk

=== Optional and other language support

Git an Java should be all you need for building the Java part of PLC4X.

==== LibPCAP (For raw-ethernet support)

The libpcap version bundled with macOS is currently 1.9.1.
This version causes exceptions.
So it's best to update to a newer version using brew:

   brew install libpcap

==== gcc (For PLC4C)

Checking:

 gcc --version

If you get any successful output, you probably don't need to do anything.

It seems macOS comes with a version of gcc which is good enough for our use cases.

==== dotnet (For PLC4Net)

Checking:

 dotnet --version

If you get any successful output, you probably don't need to do anything.

Microsoft is offering an installer for macOS which is available from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2[here].

Alternatively you can also install it via homebrew:

 brew install --cask dotnet-sdk

==== python (For PLC4Py)

Checking:

 python --version

If you get a version of 3.0.0 or higher reported, you probably don't need to do anything.

In order to install it, please execute the following command:

 brew install pyenv

Then use pyenv to install python:

 pyenv install 3.9.13

Then set this as the global python version:

 pyenv global 3.9.13

And add pyenv to the PATH:

 echo -e 'if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then\n  eval "$(pyenv init -)"\nfi' >> ~/.zshrc
 echo -e 'if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then\n  eval "$(pyenv init -)"\nfi' >> ~/.bash_profile

After opening a new terminal, `python` should be configured

 python --version
