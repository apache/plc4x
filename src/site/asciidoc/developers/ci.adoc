== Continuous Integration

We are currently using two different CI systems.

- Apache's Jenkins at: https://builds.apache.org/view/P/view/PLC4X/
- Travis at: https://travis-ci.org/apache/incubator-plc4x/

Hereby Apache Jenkins clearly is responsible for running the full testsuite with all integration-tests.
Also only jobs on Apache Jenkins are allowed to publish SNAPSHOT versions of the Maven artifacts to Apaches Nexus.

Travis integrates perfectly into GitHub. We are using this to auto-check any pull-requests coming in.
