== Continuous Integration

We are currently using the following CI systems.

- Apache's Jenkins at: https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/PLC4X/
- GitHub Actions at: https://github.com/apache/plc4x/actions

The build on Jenkins is generally responsible for building and testing the state of the project on the `development` branch.
It is currently the only service that is able to build and deploy the `SNAPSHOT` artifacts and is also responsible for building and updating our website.

GitHub Actions on the other side responsible for doing the main part of the testing.
It not only builds and runs the tests on a matrix of operating systems as well as with a number of java versions.
It also is configured to run the tests on pull-requests.

=== Structure of the Jenkins Pipeline build

We are using the Jenkins `multi-branch pipeline plugin` to automatically setup build for branches based upon the build definition in the `Jenkinsfile` in the root of the project.

In general, it builds the `develop` branch and all branches starting with the prefix `feature/`.
However, when building the `develop` branch some additional steps are performed.

When building `develop` the build not only builds the project itself and runs all tests, it also runs the `sonarcloud` analysis, deploys the artifacts built to the `Apache Nexus` as well as generates and deploys the website.
