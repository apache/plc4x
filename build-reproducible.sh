# TODO: Reproducible builds
# - Creating an RC
#   - We should run the following builds on the normal developer environment:
#     - build with all "with-*" profiles and "update-generated-code" profile enabled
#     - release:branch
#     - release:prepare
#   - The release build (release:perform) should then be run inside the docker-compose build in order to build the jars in the controlled environment
#   - Run the signing on all locally staged artifacts
#   - Transfer all locally staged artifacts to nexus
#
# - Validating an RC
#   - Download the entire content of the staging repo locally
#   - Programmatically check the Hashes and the signatures with a script
#   - Run a local build in docker-compose but with the "clean validate {compare-artifact}" config
